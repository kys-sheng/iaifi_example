## Data Augmentation for Enhancing Signal Region Robustness via multiheaded NN. <br>
Example code to show the use of Pytorch in one of my project <br>

Since this is an on-going project, I can only show partially my running code here. <br>
This is for a toy model bump hunt, with minimal test.   <br>
Complete work includes:
- BSM collider data [MG,P8, Delphes]
- More robust test [Multiple Runs]
- SR efficiency evaluation 
- etc.

Note: This will be taken down once IAIFI summer school is done. 

A complete code will be available as another public github repo once the project has been published. <br>
Feel free to contact me via email for more details.  <br>
